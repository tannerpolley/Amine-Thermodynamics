# Source Log

This source log records the manuscript's verified citation anchors and intended use. Zotero-managed bibliographic entries are stored in `references.bib`; repo-curated journal entries not present in that export are stored in `project_sources.bib`; official web/report records are stored in `official_sources.bib`.

Table 2 prints no pressure unit; kPa is read from the Fig. 2 axis on the same page ("CO2 p. pressure (kPa)"). §2.4, Eqs. 1–2 (printed p. 1426) compute the uncertainties as combined standard uncertainties u_c; no coverage factor is stated.

## Parameter Audit Notes

The numerical values below are historical source-audit evidence rather than
the active table. The live MEA mapping, evidence classes, and retained replay
are owned by `analyses/mea_parameter_bundle/`; Engine issues own generic method
work and cross-repository evidence.

- Held/Uyan ion tables provide the historical diagnostic sigma/dispersion values for `H3O+`, `OH-`, `HCO3-`, and `CO3^2-`; the historical water-ion interaction values were `0.25`, `-0.25`, `0.0`, and `-0.25`, respectively.
- Figiel2025 provides the SSM+DS Born diameter for the proton carrier (`H+` represented in the runtime as `H3O+`) as `d_born=1.218`.
- No local ePC-SAFT table value was found for SSM+DS `d_born` of `OH-`. The historical diagnostic used `d_born=3.081076894`, derived by Born hydration-energy inversion from an absolute hydroxide hydration free energy of `106.4 kcal/mol`; the derivation record is `analyses/reactive_epcsaft_parameter_evidence/results/oh_born_derivation/`.
- No local table value was found for SSM+DS `d_born` of `HCO3-` or `CO3^2-`. The regularized Tier A trace-carbonate Born diagnostic used the `3.0/3.0` pair, while an unanchored multistart diagnostic found a lower trace-only residual near `HCO3- d_born=6.80294` and `CO3^2- d_born=2.99744`; this is an identifiability boundary, not an active parameter set.
