# Full Component Parameter Source Audit

Scope:
- Local source digests in `docs/papers/md/*.md`
- `docs/latex/source_log.md`
- `docs/latex/references.bib`
- Historical parameter evidence under `data/reference/MEA/` and retained analysis results

Rules used for this audit:
- Do not fabricate missing parameter values.
- If a markdown digest mentions a parameter set but does not print the table values, treat it as "check cited table/reference".
- Deleted local parameter CSV paths below are historical locators only; they are not active parameter authority.
- Engine Issue #80 owns the next direct calculation and validated immutable packet.

## Summary

The current MEA ionic lane uses a mixed provenance:

- CO2 and H2O still come from literature seed rows.
- Neutral MEA is a literature-backed molecular fit.
- MEAH+ and MEACOO- retain provisional fixed values from an exploratory historical calculation; the current workflow evaluates but does not refit them.
- HCO3-, CO3^2-, H3O+, and OH- are diagnostic/transfer ions, but their promoted sigma/dispersion values now come from the Held/Uyan ePC-SAFT ion tables rather than generic placeholders. H3O+ also has a promoted SSM+DS Born diameter from Figiel 2025, HCO3- and CO3^2- have a trace-carbonate Born diagnostic showing that the regularized promoted values remain near `3.0/3.0` while an unanchored bicarbonate-sensitive alternative reduces the trace-only residual, and OH- has a Born hydration-energy derivation artifact supporting `d_born=3.081076894`.

The retained binary interactions are also sparse:

- `k_ij(MEA,H2O) = -0.052`
- `k_ij(MEAH+,MEACOO-) = -0.00201813457644`
- Held/Uyan water-ion interactions are promoted for H3O+, OH-, HCO3-, and CO3^2-.
- The remaining MEA-specific ionic binary terms in the promoted current CSV are zero unless fitted directly.

## Binary Interaction Notes

The retained fixed binary-interaction CSV keeps the MEA ionic lane deliberately small:

- `MEA-H2O = -0.052`
- `MEAH+-MEACOO- = -0.00201813457644`
- `H2O-H3O+ = 0.25`
- `H2O-OH- = -0.25`
- `H2O-HCO3- = 0.0`
- `H2O-CO3^2- = -0.25`
- All other retained ionic `k_ij` entries are zero

This matches the current workflow intent:

- MEA and water are the only retained neutral-pair interaction that is already explicit.
- The ion-pair interaction is a provisional fixed input rather than a current fit result.
- The bicarbonate / carbonate / hydronium / hydroxide water-ion terms follow Held/Uyan ePC-SAFT values, while the MEA-specific trace-ion interactions remain unpromoted.

## Evidence Quality Caveat

Some markdown digests only state that a parameter set was taken from literature or transferred from a prior paper, but do not print the numerical table. For those cases, the audit treats the markdown as provenance only and leaves the exact numbers to the cited table or the current CSV. That applies most strongly to the transfer-heavy ion rows.
